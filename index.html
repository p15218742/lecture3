					# 4 Basic Design Principles
					
					- **P**roximity
					- **A**lignment
					- **R**epetition
					- **C**ontrast

					(The reverse of ‘**CRAP**’)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					# **P**roximity
					**Proximity** sets up *visual cues* that group similar items, suggesting how to ‘read’ content.

					- Group **related items** with each other
					- Use **common styles** to connect grouped items
					- Sort **complex content** into groups for legibility

					The [BBC iPlayer website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer) uses proximity and containment to group related items

					The Guardian website groups ‘most popular’ news stories

				<section title="a screenshot of the Guardian website" data-background-image="images/guardian.png" data-background-size="900px"><div>&nbsp;</div></section>

				<section data-markdown>
					# **A**lignment

					- Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily
					- Every item is connected visually with other page elements

					Alignment enables page elements to be seen as **part of the whole**, creating a **holistic feel** to all the various pieces of information.

					A strict use of alignment on the [Oslo-based design agency Heydays](http://heydays.no/) gives a pleasing sense of coherence and simplicity.

					# **A**lignment: grids

					Grids are the **primary method** for achieving **alignment**.

					- **The core text** on the history and use of grids in design is: Khoi Vinh and Mark Boulton (2007) [Grids Are Good](http://www.slideshare.net/huer1278ft/grids-are-good-right)

				<section data-markdown>
					# **R**epetition

					- Repeat **design themes** throughout the interface
					- Repetition provides **consistency** across design elements
					- Consistent sizing and proportions strengthen **style**

					Use:
					
					- site-wide **templates** and **partials** for consistency
					- **style rules** for content e.g. common image sizes (at least widths), matching heading styles…

				<section data-markdown>
					# **C**ontrast

					- Make **distinctly different** items *look* different
					- Contrast makes content appear **visually inviting**

					There are many ways to create contrast. For example: *colour, fonts, rules, column widths*, etc.

					- Javascript plugin site [unheap.com](http://www.unheap.com/) uses **bold colours**
					- Design agency [Touch](http://www.thetouchagency.co.uk/) uses **hover transitions**

					# INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (IA): **1**
          
					> If you’ve ever tried to use something and thought, “where am I supposed to go next?” or “this doesn’t make any sense,” you are encountering an issue with an information architecture.

					## What is **IA**?
					
					- The **art and science** of structuring and classifying websites/intranets/apps to help people find and manage information
					- A **discipline** and community of practice bringing principles of design and architecture to online development

					Entire university courses cover Information Architecture—[search for "library science and information architecture"](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=librry+science+and+information+archtectre&oq=librry+science+and+information+archtectre&aqs=chrome..69i57.7711j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=library+science+and+information+architecture)

				<section data-markdown>
					## Origins: **Cognitive Psychology**
					
					- **Cognitive load**: how much information we can process at any time—avoiding information overload.
					- **Mental models**: the assumptions users have—information is easier to discover in familiar places.
					- **Decision making**: the cognitive process of making a choice or selecting an option—IA helps make decisions by providing contextual information at key points.

					# IA: **4**
					
					## What is Architecture?

					From Cal Henderson, [Building Scalable Web Sites](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596102357.do) (2006)

					**if buildings were like software**, the architect would be involved in the actual building process, from laying the foundations right through to installing the fixtures. …starting with a couple of rooms and some basic amenities, some people would… start living there before the building was complete. When it looked like the building work was about to finish …more people would turn up and start living there, too.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown class="left-align">
					## Building around users

					…new residents would need **new features**—more bedrooms… a swimming pool, a basement… The architect would design these… features, augmenting the original design. But when it came to building them, the **current residents wouldn't leave**. They'd continue living in the house even while it was extended, all the time complaining about the noise and dust from the building work.

					In fact… **more people would move in** while the extensions were being built. By the time the modifications were complete, more would be needed to house the newcomers and keep them happy.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown class="left-align">
					## Plan from the start
					
					The key… is **planning for these issues from the beginning**. If the architect … started out by building a huge, complex house, it would be **overkill**. By the time it was ready, the residents would have gone elsewhere to live in a smaller house built in a fraction of the time.

					If we build in such a way that extending our house takes too long then our **residents might move elsewhere**, We need to know how to start at the right scale and allow our house to be **extended as painlessly as possible**.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown class="left-align">
					## Minimize effort

					That's not to say that we're going to get anything right the first time. In the [scaling](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scaling-user-interfaces/ "Scaling User Interfaces: An Information-Processing Approach to Multi-Device Design") of a typical application, every aspect and feature is probably going to be revisited and [refactored](http://www.refactoring.com/ "a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior").

					That's fine—the task of an application architect is to **minimize the time it takes to [refactor](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring "A big site about refactoring") each component**, through careful initial and ongoing design.

					# Accessibility **1**

					“Whatever your needs or preferences, there’s almost certainly a way to access the web.

					**Theoretically**.

					In reality, the web is a mess… accessibility options tend to be forgotten or stripped away, …though accessible websites and apps can… still be beautiful, innovative… user-friendly.

					…**This is a human rights issue**. Disabled people *need* these options in order to access the web.”

					## Facts and information

					- **It’s been built into the web from the start**  
					W3C (2005) [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php)

					“the **duty to make reasonable adjustments** requires providers to **ensure disabled people can access services**. Service providers should **anticipate the needs** of potential disabled customers…”
